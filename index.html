			His cosplay journey began in 2023 where he won his first craftsmanship award at Otaku Detroit's Summer Bash, and ever since then he's been hooked. In the last few years, he's built a diverse portfolio of projects, from all kinds of media. Video games, anime, danmei, you name it. In 2024, he took a big leap and put his first cosplay drag performance on stage at Dokidokon. Since then, he's been searching for ways to outdo himself and get bigger, better, and bolder with each project. As of 2026, he holds seven craftsmanship awards and two performance awards.

			Outside of cosplay, Andy is a full-time student working towards his Bachelor of Science in Writing at Grand Valley State University. You can occasionally catch him on stage at his local community theater, where he continues to hone his performance skills. He also enjoys knitting, tap dancing, and watching Bob's Burgers for the hundreth time.
